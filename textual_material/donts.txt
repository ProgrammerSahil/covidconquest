1. Don’t just tie a scarf around your face as that can be loose fitting and need more adjustment. Use a cloth covering that is more tight-fitting.

2. Don’t panic – It is not a ‘panic-demic’ but don’t take this lightly either, especially if you are healthy! Emotional contagion is the spread of fear or panic and is more contagious than the virus itself.

3. Don’t touch your eyes, nose, mouth or face without washing your hands.

4. Don’t put your shoes on surfaces you may touch. We know that the coronavirus can sustain itself on surfaces, but don’t yet know how long.

5. Don’t treat “social distancing” like a “vacation”. This is not the time to run errands or go to the mountains. It is important to stay home and stay away from others for this to work.

6. Don’t share utensils or drinking glasses with others, including family members.

7. Don’t shake hands or give hugs as greetings. Use an alternative greeting that maintains 6-8 feet of distance.

8. Don’t go to public places like gyms, theaters, restaurants.

9.  Don’t interact with your pets if you think you may have symptoms concerning for COVID-19, as pets can be a medium for spreading the virus further.

10. Don’t call for testing if you don’t have symptoms as testing is not recommended by doctors if you don’t have symptoms.
