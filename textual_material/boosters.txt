1.) Moringa
Moringa is a herb that can ward off many health complications. And during the COVID-19 pandemic, it should be your go-to herb for immunity strengthening.

2.) Neem
Since time immemorial, neem has been respected and widely used as an immunity booster. It is very effective in keeping the body safe from attacks by harmful pathogens, thanks to its anti-viral, anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties.

3.)Tulsi
Tulsi is another wonder herb that is much favoured by Ayurveda. This aromatic leaf can be your primary line of defence against COVID-19.

4.)Ashwagandha
Ashwagandha is an adaptogen, which means it can decrease stress levels. Stress lowers your immune response and makes the body vulnerable to viral infections.

5.)Triphala
Triphala contains the antioxidative properties of three fruits- haritaki, bibhitaki and amla. It is loaded with Vitamin C and Vitamin A- both of which strengthen your immunity. Start your day with Triphala.

6.)Ginger
Ginger has been an age-old remedy for flu and the common cold. It can also be effective against COVID-19.  It contains gingerol – an antioxidant that can power up our immune system and kill viruses.

7.)Garlic
Just like ginger, garlic too will protect you from coronavirus by stimulating your immunity. It contains allicin- a plant compound that acts as a germicide. But remember, to make the most of garlic, consume it raw or partially cooked.

8.)Turmeric
Every time your grandmother said you need to consume turmeric for your health, she was right. Turmeric contains curcumin– a phytochemical that can remove toxins from your body and strengthen your immune system to fight off germs and bacteria.

9.)Black cumin
Black cumin extracts can keep you safe from a range of viruses and bacteria that attack your immune system. Both black cumin seeds and oil act as antioxidants and help flush out free radicals that weaken your immunity.
